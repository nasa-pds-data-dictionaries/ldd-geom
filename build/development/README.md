# LDD Development Build Directory

This directory will be auto-populated with dictionaries when an update is committed to a repository.

See the [LDD Update and Build Tutorial](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/support/tutorials.html#ldd-update-and-build-tutorial) for an example of how this works.
